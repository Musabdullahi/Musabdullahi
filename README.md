## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Abdullahi

I am a data analyst with a background in Computer Science and a passion for transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. This space is where I share some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on whether it's exploring data, building dashboards, or running analysis.

My work spans Data Cleaning, Processing, Analysis, and Visualization using tools like SQL, Excel and Power BI, while I continue to strengthen my Python skills to take on more advanced analytical tasks. I enjoy digging into messy datasets, spotting patterns, and telling stories with numbers that actually make sense to people.

Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering trends, making data driven decisions, and continuously improving my analytical skills through real-world projects. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of analytical case studies and dashboards that reflect my commitment, accuracy, and meaningful storytelling with data.

Iâ€™m always learning, experimenting, and looking for better ways to solve problems with data.

Feel free to take a look around!
